# Venyr.Calc Code Sample

This code sample is taken from Venyr.Calc, a personal project I started recently as I've been learning HTML. It is a calculator aimed at helping find the average damage per round (DPR) of a charcacter in Dunegons & Dragons 5th edition. The site takes in various metrics (such as character level, damage, number of attacks, etc), and calculates the estimated DPR against monsters of a difficulty fitting the character's level.

The files of interest here are 'index.html', 'script.js', and 'style.css'. As the project is still relatively new, 'style.css' is still underdeveloped, as I have focused more on the function of the site.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you!
